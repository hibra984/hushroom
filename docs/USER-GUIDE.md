## 1. Welcome to Hushroom

### What is Hushroom?

Hushroom is a **Structured Human Presence Platform** — a place where you can book sessions with trained human companions for focused, goal-bound accountability via real-time audio.

**Hushroom is NOT:**
- Therapy or counseling
- Coaching or mentoring
- Consulting or tutoring

**Hushroom IS:**
- A professional body-doubling service
- Structured accountability with a real human present
- Goal-oriented sessions with behavioral contracts
- A safe space for focused work, decisions, emotional unloading, or planning

### How It Works

```
1. Set your goal     → What do you want to accomplish?
2. Find a companion  → Smart matching finds the right person
3. Agree on rules    → A behavioral contract keeps you on track
4. Have your session  → Real-time audio with drift monitoring
5. Rate & reflect    → Both parties rate the experience
```

### Session Types

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Focus** | Deep work, body doubling | "Write 2,000 words of my thesis" |
| **Decision** | Structured decision-making | "Choose between job offers A and B" |
| **Emotional Unload** | Processing feelings | "Talk through my frustrations about work" |
| **Planning** | Goal setting & strategy | "Plan my next quarter's milestones" |

After creating a session, you'll be prompted to set a goal:

- **Description** — Detailed explanation of what you want to achieve
- **Success criteria** — Measurable outcomes (at least one required)

- **Keywords** — Tags that help matching (e.g., "writing", "academic", "focus")

Good goals are **specific, measurable, and time-bound** for the session duration.

### Understanding Matching

Once your session and goal are set, the platform finds compatible companions using a smart algorithm:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Goal Match | 35% | How well the companion's expertise matches your goal |
| Reputation | 30% | The companion's rating and track record |
| Fair Distribution | 20% | Ensures all companions get opportunities |
| Price Fit | 15% | How close their rate is to your budget |

You'll see a ranked list of compatible companions with their scores. Choose the one that feels right.

### Contracts & Rules

Before your session begins, a **behavioral contract** is created. This defines the rules for your session:

**Contract Modes:**

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Strict** | Tight rules, strong enforcement, frequent check-ins | Focus sessions, strict deadlines |
| **Moderate** | Balanced approach, reasonable flexibility | Most sessions |
| **Flexible** | Light-touch presence, minimal interruption | Emotional unload, open planning |

Both you and your companion must **accept the contract** before the session can begin.

### Payments & Billing

**How payment works:**
1. When you select a companion, a **payment hold** is placed on your card
2. No money is charged yet — it's just reserved
3. After the session completes, the **payment is captured**

**Rates by companion tier:**

## 6. Platform Features

### Drift Detection

Drift detection is Hushroom's signature feature. During a session, the system monitors for deviations from the contract:

| Severity | What Happens | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Low** | Gentle nudge | Minor topic tangent |
| **Medium** | Companion attention | Extended off-topic discussion |
| **High** | Requires acknowledgment | Ignoring session goals |
| **Critical** | Session may pause | Complete contract breach |

Drift events are logged with timestamps, and participants must acknowledge them to continue.

### Behavioral Contracts

Every session has a behavioral contract that defines:
- **Mode** — How strict the rules are (Strict/Moderate/Flexible)
- **Rules** — Specific behavioral guidelines
- **Acceptance** — Both parties must agree before starting

Contracts are based on **templates** that match session types, or can be customized.

### Smart Matching

The matching algorithm considers four factors to find your ideal companion:

1. **Goal Match (35%)** — Does the companion's expertise align with your goal?
2. **Reputation (30%)** — How well-rated is the companion?
3. **Fair Distribution (20%)** — Has this companion been getting opportunities?
4. **Price Fit (15%)** — Is their rate within your budget?

### Reputation System

Companions earn reputation through:
- Consistent high ratings
- Completing sessions successfully
- Maintaining active status
- Having many sessions (confidence builds)

Reputation uses **weighted averaging** — recent ratings matter more than old ones. Scores stabilize after 20+ ratings.

### Real-time Audio Sessions

Sessions use **LiveKit** for high-quality, low-latency audio:
- Crystal-clear voice communication
- Low latency for natural conversation
- Automatic reconnection on network issues
- Room lifecycle managed by the platform

## 9. FAQ

### General

**Q: What makes Hushroom different from a coaching platform?**
A: Coaches give advice and guidance. Hushroom companions provide *presence* — they're there as accountability witnesses, not advisors. The value is in having a structured, contracted human presence while you work on your own goals.

**Q: Do I need a webcam?**
A: No. Hushroom uses audio-only sessions. Video may be available in future updates but is not required.

**Q: Can I choose the same companion every time?**
A: Yes! While matching suggests optimal companions, you can browse and select any available companion you've worked well with before.

**Q: What if my companion doesn't show up?**
A: If a companion fails to join, the session is cancelled and your payment hold is released. You can report a no-show for admin review.

### Sessions

**Q: How long are sessions?**
A: Sessions range from 15 to 120 minutes. The default is 30 minutes.

**Q: Can I pause during a session?**
A: Yes. Both you and your companion can pause and resume the session.

**Q: What happens if I go off-topic?**
A: The drift detection system will alert you with varying severity. Your companion may also gently remind you of your goal and contract.

**Q: Can I cancel a session?**
A: Yes, you can cancel before the session starts. Once in progress, you can end it early but the payment may still be captured.

### Payments

**Q: When am I charged?**
A: A hold is placed when you select a companion. You're only charged after the session completes.

**Q: How do refunds work?**
A: Refunds are issued for technical failures, companion no-shows, or admin-approved disputes. Contact support for refund requests.

**Q: What payment methods are accepted?**
A: All major credit/debit cards via Stripe (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.).

### Companions

**Q: How do I become a companion?**
A: Register a user account, then apply to become a companion. An admin will review your application.

**Q: How much can I earn?**
A: Earnings depend on your rate, number of sessions, and tier. Top companions can earn €2-4K/month part-time.

**Q: How do I get promoted to a higher tier?**
A: Tiers are based on session count, rating average, and identity verification. Maintain high quality and the platform will upgrade you.

### Privacy

**Q: Is my session audio recorded?**
A: No. Sessions are not recorded. Audio is real-time only and not stored.

**Q: Can I see who rated me?**
A: Ratings can be public or private. Public ratings show the reviewer's name. Private ratings are anonymous.

**Q: How do I delete my data?**
A: Go to Profile > Delete Account. Your account will be deactivated and your data will be purged according to our retention policy.
